Gesture Dino Game

## 🎯 Overview

This project is a **Chrome Dino–style running game** controlled entirely by **hand gestures** — no keyboard or mouse needed!

You jump using your **open palm**, detected in real time via your webcam using **MediaPipe** and **OpenCV**.  
The game visuals and physics are built using **Pygame**.


## 🧩 Main Features

- ✅ Hand Gesture Jump (Open Palm → Jump)  
- ✅ Auto-detect ground level from background image  
- ✅ Increasing speed and score as game progresses  
- ✅ Smooth restart after collision  
- ✅ Real-time webcam window showing gesture detection  
- ✅ Fully offline — runs locally with camera  


## 🛠 Requirements

Before running the game, install dependencies:

```bash
pip install pygame opencv-python mediapipe numpy
````


## 📂 Project Files

| File Name         | Purpose                           |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `game.py`         | Main game logic + gesture control |
| `assets/back.png` | Background image                  |
| `assets/dino.png` | Dino sprite image                 |

> **Note:** You must have the `assets` folder in the same directory as `game.py`.


## 🎮 How It Works

### 1. Game Setup

* Initializes Pygame window (900×400).
* Loads background (`back.png`) and Dino (`dino.png`) images.
* Detects ground level automatically.
* Spawns random cactus-like obstacles that scroll left.

### 2. Camera + Hand Detection

* Opens webcam using `cv2.VideoCapture(0)`.
* Uses **MediaPipe Hands** to track your hand landmarks.
* Checks if **4 or more fingers are raised** → counts as an **open palm**.
* Displays a second window showing your live camera feed + detected hand skeleton.

### 3. Jump Control

* If an open palm is detected (`open_hand=True`) and the dino is on the ground, it triggers a **jump**.
* Jump physics:

  * Initial velocity = -13 (upward)
  * Gravity = 0.8 (pulls down)
* Smooth jump arc like the Chrome Dino game.

### 4. Obstacles & Scoring

* Random cactus-shaped green obstacles move left.
* Player score increases as time passes.
* Game speed increases every few hundred points.

### 5. Collision & Restart

* If dino collides with a cactus:

  * Displays “GAME OVER - Restarting...”
  * Waits 0.9 seconds
  * Resets score, obstacles, and speed automatically


## 🧠 Gesture Logic Explained

| Condition                | Meaning                        | Action    |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------ | --------- |
| ✋ Open Palm              | 4 or more fingers up           | Jump      |
| ✊ Closed Fist            | Fingers down                   | No action |
| 🖐️ Continuous Open Palm | Only first frame triggers jump |           |


## 🪄 Controls Summary

| Action      | How to Perform                    |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| Jump        | Show open palm to webcam          |
| Quit Game   | Press **ESC** or close the window |
| Quit Camera | Press **ESC** on camera window    |


## 💡 Troubleshooting

| Issue                      | Solution                                                              |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Camera not opening         | Check webcam connection; try another index like `cv2.VideoCapture(1)` |
| Error: “Cannot load asset” | Ensure `assets/back.png` and `assets/dino.png` exist                  |
| Dino not jumping           | Ensure your hand is clearly visible and well-lit                      |
| Too fast / Too slow        | Adjust `INITIAL_SPEED` or `SPEED_INCREASE_EVERY` in config section    |
| Frame stuck / laggy        | Reduce camera resolution or close other apps using webcam             |

| Section          | Function                                                          |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CONFIG           | Screen settings, game speed, and asset paths                      |
| Gesture Helper   | Uses MediaPipe to detect open hand                                |
| Utility Function | Detects ground Y-position automatically from background image     |
| Game Setup       | Initializes images, variables, and starting state                 |
| Main Loop        | Combines camera input, gesture detection, game logic, and drawing |
| Cleanup          | Closes camera and game windows properly                           |


## 📸 Workshop Flow (Suggested)

1. Run a **camera test** using:

```bash
python -m cv2
```

(or use a separate `camera_test.py` to verify webcam works)

2. Run the game:

```bash
python gesture_dino_ui.py
```

3. Show open hand ✋ to jump.
4. Demonstrate gesture control, score increase, and auto-restart.


## 🧰 Tech Stack

* **Python 3.8+**
* **MediaPipe** – Real-time hand landmark detection
* **OpenCV** – Webcam capture and visualization
* **Pygame** – Game engine and rendering
* **NumPy** – Array math and background analysis

## 🏁 Summary

You’ve built a **gesture-controlled Chrome Dino game clone**!
The Dino runs automatically, and you jump using hand gestures tracked live via your webcam.
Perfect for workshops, demos, and learning **computer vision + game integration**.
