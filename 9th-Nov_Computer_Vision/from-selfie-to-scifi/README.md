# From Selfie to Sci-Fi

A progressive computer vision project that transforms selfies into sci-fi themed images.

## Project Structure

This project is organized into progressive modules:

### 01_face_detection
Basic face detection functionality.

### 02_face_landmarks
Facial landmark detection for precise face feature localization.

### 03_filter_overlay
Filter overlay utilities and glow effects.

### 04_emotion_glow
Emotion detection and emotion-based glow effects.

### 05_final_project
Final sci-fi filter that combines all previous modules.

## Getting Started

1. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
```

2. Start with the basic face detection module:
```bash
cd 01_face_detection
python face_basic.py
```

3. Progress through each module to build up to the final sci-fi filter.
